## Hi, I'm Ignacio Fernández

* 🖥️ I've been coding for over 5 years.
* 🏗️ I'm enthusiastic about infrastructure and have been focusing a lot on DBA tasks lately.
* 🐰 Currently learning Kubernetes and RabbitMQ (with a focus on MQTT).
* 🔉 In 2022, I released two albums. Both are available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/artist/2ushfz0EHB5EGAqxtTsOSI?si=L-BVIhe6QFGAfszqSRUhRw) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@_iferdel/playlists)
* 📕 In 2024, I published a [book](https://iferdel.com/inicio/20-a-la-sombra-de-un-olivo-generoso.html) (Spanish only) and actively marketed it through an e-commerce platform.

I've been enjoying Go projects along with infrastructure-related tasks. Moreover, I'm thrilled with time-series data—lately, I’ve been exploring TimescaleDB as a PostgreSQL extension with compelling results.
