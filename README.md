## Hi, I'm Ignacio Fernández

* 🖥️ I've been coding for over 5 years.
* 🏗️ I'm enthusiastic about infrastructure and have been focusing a lot on DBA tasks lately.
* 🐰 Currently learning Kubernetes and RabbitMQ (with a focus on MQTT).

I've been enjoying Go projects along with infrastructure-related tasks. Moreover, I'm thrilled with time-series data—lately, I’ve been exploring TimescaleDB as a PostgreSQL extension with compelling results.
